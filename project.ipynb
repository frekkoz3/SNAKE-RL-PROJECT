    "### **The Game**\n",
    "\n",
    "For who who doesn't know Snake is a not just a game but a genre of action video games.\\\n",
    "It was born in 1976 competitive arcade video game Blockade, where the goal was to survive longer than others players while collecting the most possible food.\\\n",
    "In this game you control the head of a snake on grid world and you aim to eat some food in order to become bigger. The big difficulty here is that if you hit your tail (this is the only common rule for all snake variant) you die.\\\n",
    "There are multiple version of the game and some of them are really weird (where teleportation can occour or some food can actually make you die).\\\n",
    "We took in account the most basic version, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The world is a discrete grid world of size $n\\times m$\n",
    "2. There is always only one food (apple) on the grid world, and when you it changes position\n",
    "3. There are no periodic boundary conditions, meaning that if you hit a wall you die\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest is just as described as in the introduction to the game.\\\n",
    "Little side note is that this version is inspired by the \"Snake Byte\" published by Sirius Software in 1982.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to Gymnasium and PyGame the implementation of this simple version of the game is pretty straightforward.\\\n",
    "Developed completely in Python in the file \"snake_environment.py\", this implementation follows the Gym protocol, defining:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Step\n",
    "2. Reset\n",
    "3. Render, which use PyGame\n",
    "4. Close\n",
    "\n",
    "All others functions are private and only used inside the class, for the exception of \"get_possible_action\" which is useful for our purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing is that we actually defined a maximum number of step inside the environment to prevent infinte loop driven by bad policies while training. This is a parameter for the __init__ with default value 1000."

    "\n",
    "Once the environment is defined, one can think about how big the space of all possible configuration is.\\\n",
    "Well, doing some (pretty bad but although valid) approximation, considering a state as the matrix representation of the grid with 0 (empty cell), 1 (apple), 2(head) and 3 (tail), the dimension of all possible configuration ends up being something like this:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    |S| = (n\\times m)(n\\times m)2^{(n\\times m)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This should describe all the possible positions of the apple, all the possible position of the head and all possible configuration on the grid of the tails (now this is the big approximation, since the tail configuration is not independent from the head position). Anyway, even if this is an approximation one can simply add the \"blocks\" on the grid world (static cells that kill, if touched, the snake) and the dimension should exactly being that big.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **BIDDING (or Bracketing)**\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown before the Snake game has a huge state dimension.\\\n",
    "Since a look up table of that dimension has no logic to exist (I don't even think our computers can store something like that) and since it is pretty impossible just to see one example for each pair state-action in an entire life time, something had to come in mind.\\\n",
    "Thanks to a lesson we learnt about bidding (that we called bracketing for the entire project, shame on Francesco) and decided to try it out.\\\n",
    "Bidding essentially is just a supervised technique (it is the human that codifies how it works) that agglomerates similar states together, in order to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.\\\n",
    "A very stupid example could be the following: each state just randomly be labelled as 0 or 1. And the agents now will not see the entire state representation, but only the label you gave it. Now this example is stupid because, using this random strategy, you end up with no knowledge at all. BUT, look at what happened at your state dimension: it fell down from whatever it was to 2! Pretty neat, uh?\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed together end decided to try a lot of different bidding techniques, and we end up discovering the big tradeoff in this field: **information against dimension**.\\\n",
    "Minimal state bidding are easy to implement, but if they are too small it is not ensured that they will bring enough information to actually learn to the agent. On the other hand, if you give too many information to the agent, you will end up again with a too big state dimension to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of bidding is that you actually \"completely\" lose the transition function below your system. It is true that you can develop a new transition function on a new space, the \"bidding space\", but it is not easy and it is not ensured to be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will quickly see all the biddings we implemented. We defined in the states_bracket.py a super class (StateBracket) which implement the protocol for all the bidding techniques."

    "### **FOOD INFORMATION ONLY**\n",

    "1. Food Relative Position \n",
    "2. Food Direction\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### **Food Relative Position**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the apple position $(a_y, a_x)$ and the head position $(h_y, h_x)$ you just return as state the tuple $(a_y - h_y, a_x - h_x)$. This approach reduces the states' dimension up to $2m \\times 2n$\n",

    "Now, while the first one is straightforward, this a little more subtle. This tells you whether your head is above, below, to the left, or to the right of the food. \\\n",
